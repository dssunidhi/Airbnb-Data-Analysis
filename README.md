My project is a data analysis of Airbnb listings in New York City from 2019. I used a publicly available dataset and a Jupyter notebook to explore key trends and gain insights.

The project involved three main steps:
1.  **Data Cleaning:** I handled missing values in the dataset and removed outliers to ensure the data was accurate and reliable for analysis.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I explored the dataset to understand the distribution of listings by neighborhood and borough, the typical price range, and the types of rooms available (e.g., private rooms, entire homes).
3.  **Key Insights:** The analysis focused on understanding the relationship between price, location, and room type. I also examined the availability of listings throughout the year.

The main takeaway is that I was able to use data to provide a clear picture of the NYC Airbnb market, identifying trends that could be useful for both hosts and guests.
